# Machine Learned Sum Function

Machine Learning (ML) increasingly governs our modern society and it is vital that errors are defined and anomalies are detected for any given scenario. 
Sum function is considered to unveil the errors and the anomalies, as sum is the elemental function from a mathematician's perspective.

* Two learning models, Linear Regression and Neural Networks were designed to learn the sum function.
